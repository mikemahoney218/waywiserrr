\title{waywiserrr: waywiser Rewritten in Rust: Ergonomic Methods for Assessing Spatial Models}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

This package is an experimental fork of the 'waywiser' package, replacing slow calculations with implementations written in Rust. This package will not be released to CRAN, and there is currently no intention of the Rust rewrites making their way upstream to the original package; the maintenance burden that would involve outweighs the speed benefits. There is also no promise that improvements in the upstream repo ever migrate to this package. As described in the original package, assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, both because these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the original region represented by training data and due to potential spatially structured errors, with "hot spots" of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying data. Methods are provided for assessing models fit to spatial data, including approaches for measuring the spatial structure of model errors, assessing model predictions at multiple spatial scales, and evaluating where predictions can be made safely. Methods are particularly useful for models fit using the 'tidymodels' framework. Methods include Moran's I ('Moran' (1950) \doi{10.2307/2332142}), Geary's C ('Geary' (1954) \doi{10.2307/2986645}), Getis-Ord's G ('Ord' and 'Getis' (1995) \doi{10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x}), agreement coefficients from 'Ji' and Gallo (2006) (\doi{ 10.14358/PERS.72.7.823}), agreement metrics from 'Willmott' (1981) (\doi{ 10.1080/02723646.1981.10642213}) and 'Willmott' 'et' 'al'. (2012) (\doi{ 10.1002/joc.2419}), an implementation of the area of applicability methodology from 'Meyer' and 'Pebesma' (2021) (\doi{10.1111/2041-210X.13650}), and an implementation of multi-scale assessment as described in 'Riemann' 'et' 'al'. (2010) (\doi{10.1016/j.rse.2010.05.010}).
