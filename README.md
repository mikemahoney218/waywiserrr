waywiserrr is
[waywise**r**](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/waywiser/),
**r**ewritten in **R**ust. I’m using this repo to experiment with using
Rust in R packages, and to try and muddle my way through learning
ndarray.

You probably shouldn’t use this; this repo forked from waywiser a while
back, with most bug fixes and feature additions put into the main repo.
I’m also not particularly likely to port any of this code into the main
repo, as the speedups don’t yet justify the headache of maintaining a
package with compiled code (or, in particular, maintaining a package
with Rust code).
