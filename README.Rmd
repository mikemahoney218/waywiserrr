# waywiserrr <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/waywiser/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" /></a>

waywiserrr is [waywise**r**](https://docs.ropensci.org/waywiser/), 
**r**ewritten in **R**ust. I'm using this repo to experiment with using Rust
in R packages, and to try and muddle my way through learning ndarray.

You probably shouldn't use this; this repo forked from waywiser a while back, 
with most bug fixes and feature additions put into the main repo. I'm also not
particularly likely to port any of this code into the main repo, as the speedups
don't yet justify the headache of maintaining a package with compiled code 
(or, in particular, maintaining a package with Rust code).
